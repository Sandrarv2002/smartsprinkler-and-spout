PROJECT TITLE: SMART SPRINKLER 

DESCRIPTION

Introducing the Smart Sprinkler System: Revolutionizing Irrigation Management 
Smart Sprinkler System embodies a contemporary approach to irrigation management, leveraging cutting-edge sensor technologies and microcontroller-based control for enhanced precision and convenience. By integrating sensors for atmospheric pressure, temperature and humidity, and a soil moisture sensor, alongside microcontroller, the system enables real-time monitoring and control of critical watering parameters.

Key features of the Smart sprinkler include its ability to gather data on atmospheric conditions, soil moisture levels, and ambient temperature, allowing for dynamic adjustment of watering schedules based on actual environmental conditions. This data-driven approach ensures that plants receive the appropriate amount of water at the right time, promoting optimal growth and resource efficiency.

Furthermore, the smart sprinkler incorporates a dedicated mobile application " SPOUT "that empowers users to remotely manage and monitor watering schedules from anywhere with internet connectivity. Through the app, users can customize watering settings, receive alerts and notifications ,thereby facilitating convenient and efficient irrigation management.
